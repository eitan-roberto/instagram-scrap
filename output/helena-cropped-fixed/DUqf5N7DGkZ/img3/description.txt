**Outfit Details:**
A female model wears a black cropped short-sleeved top with a double-breasted button-up style, revealing her midriff. She pairs this with a black mini skirt, possibly a skort, featuring two small buttons on the left waist. On her legs are white knee-high socks with a purple and light purple argyle pattern. Her footwear consists of black loafers. A thin gold-colored bracelet adorns her right wrist.

**Pose:**
The model stands facing forward, looking slightly downwards. Her hands are raised to her head, actively ruffling or styling her brown hair, giving it a voluminous, slightly messy appearance.

**Setting:**
The scene is a modern bathroom or shower stall with light beige square tiled walls and floor. On the left wall, there is a recessed niche containing various toiletries and beauty products. On the right, a chrome shower head, a mixing valve, and a flexible shower hose are mounted on the wall. A square drain cover is visible on the tiled floor. Parts of a clear glass shower screen are visible on either side of the frame.

**Lighting:**
The lighting is bright and even, casting minimal shadows, suggesting soft, diffused ambient light, likely from overhead fixtures.

**Camera Angle:**
The camera is positioned at a medium height, capturing a full-body shot of the model from just above her head to her feet, at a straight-on or very slightly upward angle.
