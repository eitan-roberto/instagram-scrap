**Outfit Details:** The model is wearing a multi-colored knitted hat with ear flaps, a vibrant red short-sleeved t-shirt with a light pink graphic print featuring a stylized firearm and the partial text "BORN LIKE" or similar, and a red velvet jacket with intricate embroidered patterns. She is also wearing green and beige camouflage cargo pants. Her fingernails are painted with dark blue nail polish.

**Pose:** The model is kneeling or sitting low on the grass, facing slightly to the right with her body angled towards the camera. Her right arm is bent, resting on the back of a wicker chair, while her left hand is holding onto one of the ear flaps of her hat, pulling it slightly away from her face. Her expression is a subtle pout or serious gaze, looking directly at the camera. Her hair is styled in a bob and appears slightly windswept, framing her face.

**Setting:** The photo is taken outdoors in a well-maintained grassy yard or garden. In the background, there is a white house with a visible window, set behind a short wall and stone steps. Bare trees and leafless shrubs are visible, suggesting a colder season like late winter or early spring. A brown/reddish wicker outdoor chair is positioned next to the model, supporting her right arm. The overall atmosphere is natural and somewhat rustic.

**Lighting:** The lighting is natural and soft, likely from an overcast sky or late afternoon sun, providing even illumination without harsh shadows. The grass is well-lit, and the model's features are clearly visible.

**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a medium level, slightly below eye-level, capturing the model from the waist up to the top of her hat, with a good portion of her lower body and pants also in frame.
