**Outfit Details:**
The model is wearing a chic houndstooth or small plaid blazer in shades of tan/brown and off-white. The blazer features notched lapels, a single-breasted closure with a dark button, and matching dark buttons on the cuffs. Underneath, she has a simple white crew-neck t-shirt. Her accessories include a delicate gold-toned chain necklace with a small pendant, small gold-toned earrings, and dark sunglasses perched on top of her head. She carries a black shoulder bag with prominent, long fringes, likely made of faux leather or suede.

**Pose:**
The model strikes a playful and slightly quirky pose, looking directly at the camera with puckered lips, creating a "duck face" expression. Her right arm is raised, balancing a clear glass containing a drink with a lime slice on top of her head, over her sunglasses. Her left arm is bent, holding the fringed bag against her side.

**Setting:**
The scene is an indoor, dimly lit environment, characteristic of a bar or lounge. To the left, a wooden bar counter with a metal rail is visible, along with a bright red object (possibly a piece of bar equipment) and the arm of another person seated at the bar. The background on the right is dark and somewhat reflective, showing subtle ambient lights and a small yellow mushroom-shaped lamp on a table further back, contributing to a cozy, evening atmosphere.

**Lighting:**
The lighting is dim and atmospheric, with the primary light source appearing to come from the front, slightly to the model's right, illuminating her face and the front of her blazer. This creates some highlights on her hair and the glass she's holding, while the background remains largely in shadow, enhancing the intimate, evening bar ambiance.

**Camera Angle:**
The camera angle is roughly at eye-level or slightly below, positioning the viewer directly across from the model and capturing her playful expression and unique pose head-on.
