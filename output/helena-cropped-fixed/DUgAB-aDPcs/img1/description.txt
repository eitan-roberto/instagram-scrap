**Outfit Details:** The model is wearing a short, sleeveless dress with a vibrant leopard print pattern in shades of brown, black, and tan. Underneath, she has on opaque, electric blue tights. Her footwear consists of black high heels with a pointed toe and a thin heel, worn over the blue tights. She also has several small, colorful bracelets on her right wrist.

**Pose:** The model is captured in a dynamic pose, standing on the pedals of a stationary exercise bike as if mid-pedal stroke, leaning forward slightly. Her right hand is gripping the left handlebar, while her left arm is mostly out of frame but appears to be holding the right handlebar. Her head is turned slightly to the right, looking upwards and to the right with a serious expression, emphasizing her profile. One leg is extended forward, bent at the knee, with the high heel resting on the pedal, while the other leg is bent back, suggesting movement.

**Setting:** The setting is an indoor space, likely a living room or home gym area. The background features a plain, light beige wall that takes up most of the upper part of the frame. Below, there's a long, low-slung sofa upholstered in a warm, distressed brown leather, possibly a sectional, which spans across the middle background. There are dark, geometric, possibly wooden or metal, tables or bases integrated with the sofa. The floor is a light, neutral-colored carpet or rug, possibly off-white or very light grey.

**Lighting:** The lighting appears to be soft and even, suggesting either diffused natural light from an unseen window or well-distributed artificial lighting. There are no harsh shadows, indicating a broad light source. The model's face is well-lit, and the details of her outfit and the setting are clearly visible.

**Camera Angle:** The camera is positioned at a slightly low to eye-level angle relative to the model, looking directly at her side profile. This angle captures her full height, the exercise bike, and a good portion of the background, making the model and the bike the central focus.
