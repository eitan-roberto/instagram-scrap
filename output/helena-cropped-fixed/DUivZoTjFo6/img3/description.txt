  "outfit_details": "The model is wearing a black, short-sleeved, cropped top with a double-breasted or vest-like button-front design, exposing a sliver of her midriff. Below, she wears a black mini skirt, possibly a skort given the slight wrap-around or asymmetrical detail on one side. Her legs are adorned with knee-high argyle socks featuring white, purple, and a lighter contrasting color pattern. She completes the look with classic black loafers. A subtle gold-colored bracelet is visible on her right wrist.",
  "pose": "The model stands upright, facing the camera with her head tilted downwards. Both of her hands are raised, running through or gripping her hair, which appears deliberately tousled or messy.",
  "setting": "The setting is a contemporary bathroom, specifically inside a walk-in shower enclosure. The walls and floor are tiled with large, light-colored (cream or beige) tiles. A built-in wall niche on the left side holds various bath products. Chrome shower fixtures, including a handheld showerhead on an adjustable rail and a thermostatic mixer, are visible on the right wall. A clear glass shower partition extends from the floor upwards on the right, and a square drain is visible on the shower floor.",
  "lighting": "The lighting is bright and even, likely artificial overhead bathroom lighting, illuminating the scene without harsh shadows, creating a clean and well-lit environment.",
  "camera_angle": "The camera angle is straight on, capturing the model from a full-body perspective, from slightly above her head down to her feet."
