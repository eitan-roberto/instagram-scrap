**Outfit Details:** The model is wearing a light grey long-sleeved top with a V-neckline and subtle ribbing, possibly a wrap-style or layered design around the bust. It appears to be made of a soft, stretchy material. She is also wearing matching light grey fitted pants or leggings.

**Pose:** The model is leaning forward and to her left, with her right elbow resting on the ironing board. Her left arm is raised above her head, with her hand positioned in an artful, somewhat stylized gesture. Her head is tilted slightly, and she is looking directly at the camera with a serious or slightly pensive expression. Her posture suggests a blend of casualness and intentional posing.

**Setting:** The setting appears to be a laundry room or utility space. In the background, there's a light-colored wall, a teal plastic laundry basket on a green surface, and various cleaning product bottles. An ironing board with a light blue patterned cover is in the foreground, with a white shirt draped over it and an iron standing upright. To the far right, part of a drying rack is visible. The floor is tiled.

**Lighting:** The lighting is soft and even, suggesting ambient indoor light, possibly from a window or overhead fixtures not directly visible. There are no harsh shadows, creating a natural and well-lit scene.

**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is eye-level with the model, capturing her upper body and the immediate surroundings of the ironing board. It provides a full view of her pose and the context of the laundry area.
