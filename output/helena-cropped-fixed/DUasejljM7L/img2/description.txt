  "outfit_details": "The model wears a matching grey two-piece loungewear set. The top is a long-sleeved, ribbed material with a scooped neckline and thumbholes on the cuffs. It features subtle stitching details and an asymmetrical or wrap-around design. The bottoms are wide-leg or flared trousers in the same grey ribbed material. She completes the look with vibrant pink open-toed high heels, adding an unexpected and contrasting pop of color.",
  "pose": "The model is captured in a highly dynamic and acrobatic pose, leaning back dramatically with her body arched. Her head is tilted upwards, and her hair is slightly disheveled, suggesting movement. Her left arm is extended and bent upwards, with her hand open near the wall, while her right hand is placed on the green countertop for support. Her legs are bent, and her feet, adorned with pink heels, are also positioned on the countertop, creating a surreal, suspended effect. The pose conveys flexibility, strength, and a sense of theatricality.",
  "setting": "The setting is a domestic utility or laundry room. The background consists of a plain light beige or off-white wall. A green countertop spans the wall, serving as a perch for the model. Various laundry supplies are visible on the countertop, including a turquoise laundry basket, several bottles of detergent (e.g., 'Weißer Riese', 'TANDIL'), and a white metal drying rack. In the foreground, an ironing board with a blue patterned cover holds a white shirt, next to a blue and black iron. The mundane, utilitarian setting provides a strong contrast to the model's high-fashion look and pose.",
  "lighting": "The lighting is soft, even, and appears to be indoor, possibly from an overhead or diffused source. There are no harsh shadows, indicating a well-lit environment that highlights the details of the outfit and setting without creating dramatic contrasts.",
  "camera_angle": "The camera angle is positioned at eye-level or slightly below, capturing the model's full body and the surrounding environment. This angle allows for a comprehensive view of her dramatic pose and the elements of the laundry room, placing the viewer directly into the scene."
